# Reboot by Aberration Creations

A demoscene production.

Visuals and Music: Musk
Engine code: Citrus

Runs on windows, linux and macos (m1). The code is sketchy, as this was our first "bigger" project with Zig.
We enjoyed the process a lot! <3 

## How to run

Below you will find the zig version that we used for this. 
Put it in PATH on your operating system. We might or might not update zig version
in the future. If you do it for us, we will be eternally grateful. 
Then you will need to install VulkanSDK. After this it is just simple 
zig build run. If you want to play the music, or you want to enjoy it 
in fullscreen, then in src/main.zig set the isMusic and/or isRelease to true.
Have fun!

## Zig version

We use a fixed zig version `0.11.0-dev.1822+98508a12c` for this repo.

Musk is the owner of the music and shaders, I got permission to upload it as a group member, but if you need permission as well,
you have to ask for it!
